\section{Tree Structure}

% FIXME:
% * Are you also keeping track of the well-formedness of the tree somehow? 
%   Is it an assumption or do you throw an error if you somehow detect a cycle?
% * Is there a state transition between the Active-Frozen-Disabled?
% * bring back the intuition of why a tree is a better structure

    Each pointer is given a tag (opaque, impossible to forge, primitive operation to create a fresh tag)
    ~\\
    What (Tree|Stacked) Borrows track:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{permission} of each tag for each location;
        \item some \textbf{structure} between those tags;
        \item all accesses are done through a tag:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item read/write accesses \textbf{require permissions} on the tag used,\\
                    UB occurs if the permissions are insufficient;
                \item read/write accesses \textbf{alter permissions} of other tags,\\
                    UB occurs if the modification is forbidden;

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Summary}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item pointers are identified by a tag, and tags are stored in a tree structure;
        \item a reborrow of \(t\) either...
            \begin{itemize}
                \item creates a new tag \(t'\), \(t'\) is recorded as a child of \(t\), or
                \item keeps the same tag \(t\).
            \end{itemize}
        \item each tag has a permission on each location:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item accesses through child tags are \textit{child accesses},
                \item accesses through non-child tags are \textit{foreign accesses},
                \item all accesses can cause a modification of the permission, and some modifications are indicators of UB.
            \end{itemize}
