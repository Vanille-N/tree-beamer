\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Notable examples}
    \begin{block}{Accesses outside range}
        UB in \texttt{tokio}, \texttt{pyo3}, \texttt{rkyv}, \texttt{eyre}, \texttt{ndarray}, ...\\
        according to SB but not TB
    \end{block}
    \begin{block}{Invalidations by mutable reborrows (``\texttt{as\_mut\_ptr}'' pattern)}
        UB in \texttt{arrayvec}, \texttt{slotmap}, \texttt{nalgebra}, \texttt{json}, ...\\
        according to SB but not TB
    \end{block}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Summary}
    % FIXME: rework
    \begin{itemize}
        \item patterns allowed by Stacked Borrows but forbidden by Tree Borrows are rare
        \item Tree Borrows UB is much less common on \texttt{crates.io}
        \item elimination of out-of-bounds UB
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Questions ?}

    TB also has...
    \begin{itemize}
        \item tweaked rules for interactions between interior mutability and protectors/\texttt{Reserved}
        \item performance improvements compared to the naive implementation
            \begin{itemize}
                \item many tricks to trim tree traversals
                \item lazy initialization for out-of-range accesses
            \end{itemize}
        \item ongoing attempt at formalization in Coq
    \end{itemize}
