1st slide: standard aliasing xor mutability visual

(2) del
start with concrete example
(audience knows Rust, yay)
Slide 4's example is fine, but less text and align the code
Title "Absence of aliasing allows optimizations"
It's ok for not all slides to have a title

show context that violates optimization
It's not the optimization that's wrong, it's the code

-> define exactly why this program is wrong
-> concrete rules to describe and detect wrong programs

déjà vu ? Stacked Borrows (successor)

(5) too much text but maybe we do want to start with a high level description ?
every pointer has a tag, and we keep track of where the pointer comes from in a big tree
  zones self, strict children, parents, cousins
  introduce the state upfront (sweep initialized under the rug) ?
    minimum so that we can show the example
    have a quick reference in the corner (simplified state machine + intuition)
  
visual representation
- 1 location -> put the permission in the tree (after they have been introduced; first only the tag)
- make the tree center aligned instead of flushed left

go through the example step by step
  + version that's not rejected

simplify the state machine
  text on the arrows, combine arrows with same effect
  reserved implicitly only initial state

example with shared reference then ?

 >o[Res]
     |  \
  o[Act] |
     |  \|
 >o[Frz] |
        \|
       [Dis]


Example involving 2-phase borrows
  if it doesn't compile, write it

{MAYBE
    Then introduce protectors
    - motivation for why we need this
    - how protectors affect the existing permissions
      (mention some complications (& backup slide):
       - interior mutable shared reference, raw pointers work the same
       - interior mutability affects reserved)

     >o[Res]
         |  \
      o[Act] [Con]o

     >o[Frz]

    (probably not enough time for conflicted in detail)
}

Finish with comparison with SB
- some code example that passes TB but not SB
